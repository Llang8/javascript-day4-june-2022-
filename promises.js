/*
 * A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. 
 * It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success 
 * value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous 
 * methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method 
 * returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.
 * 
 * A Promise is in one of these states:
 *
 * pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
 * fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
 * rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
